# Get Involved

## Improve the Documentation Platform

**We are always on looking for a helping hand!**

Our current focus is to make the documentation platform _really
awesome_, and we encourage everyone to chime in by either updating docs, or open
issues if specific docs are confusing or unclear. 

There's no specific skillset required. If you are beginner and not feeling
confident contributing, then by just giving feedback you are already making a
valuable contribution to the community!

The documentation for this website can be found
[here](https://github.com/reason-association/reasonml.org). Make sure to read
the [CONTRIBUTING
file](https://github.com/reason-association/reasonml.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
first.
