# Interop Miscellaneous

## Composing `bs` Attributes

As you might have guessed, most `bs.*` attributes can be used together. Here's an extreme example:

Note that `bs.splice` was renamed to `bs.variadic` after version 4.08

```reason
[@bs.val] [@bs.scope "global"] [@bs.variadic]
external draw : ([@bs.as "dog"] _, array(int)) => unit = "draw";

draw([|1, 2|]);
```

Output:

```js
global.draw("dog", 1, 2);
```

## Safe External Data Handling

In some cases, the data could either come from JS or BS; it's very hard to give precise type information because of this. For example, for an external promise whose creation could come from the JS API, its failed value caused by `Promise.reject` could be of any shape.

BuckleScript provides a solution, `bs.open`, to filter out OCaml structured exception data from the mixed data source. It preserves type safety while allowing you to deal with mixed source. It makes use of OCamlâ€™s extensible variant, so that users can mix values of type `exn` with JS data.

```reason
let handleData = [@bs.open] (
  fun
  | Invalid_argument(_) => 0
  | Not_found => 1
  | Sys_error(_) => 2
);

/* handleData is 'a => option(int) */
```

For any input source, as long as it matches the exception pattern (nested pattern match supported), the matched value is returned, otherwise return `None`.
