# New Project

Once you've installed BuckleScript from the previous section, you can generate a lightweight project template:

```sh
bsb -init my-new-project
```

Alternatively, to start a new [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io) project:

```sh
bsb -init my-new-project -theme basic-reason
```

To compile & run the project you just created:

```sh
cd my-new-project
npm install
npm run build
node src/Demo.bs.js
```

And that's it! You've just built the project once and ran the JS output. Feel free to inspect the js output, add a few files in `my-new-project/src`, etc. Hopefully we've delivered on our promise of being a lean toolchain with clean output =).

We'll explain `bsb`, the build system called by the above `npm run build`, in a later section.

## Editor Integration

We share the same editor integration as Reason. See the setup [here](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/installation.html) then [here](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/editor-plugins).
