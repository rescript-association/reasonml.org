# Embed Raw JavaScript

We're introducing this **last-resort** escape hatch first, in case you're ever stuck trying the other more legitimate APIs and wanna move on. Here's how you can drop a chunk of JavaScript right into your BuckleScript file:

```reason
let add = [%raw {|
  function(a, b) {
    console.log("hello from raw JavaScript!");
    return a + b
  }
|}];

Js.log(add(1, 2));
```

The `{|foo|}` syntax stands for OCaml/BuckleScript/Reason's multi-line, "quoted string" syntax. Think of them as the equivalent of JavaScript's template literals. No escaping is needed inside that string.

**Careful** with the OCaml/Reason syntax here. `[%raw foo]` allows you to embed an expression. For top-level declarations in OCaml/Reason, use `[%%raw foo]` (two `%`):

```reason
[%%raw "var a = 1"];

let f = [%raw "function() {return 1}"];
```

<!-- TODO: add explaination about extension syntax  -->
<!-- TODO: add reason counter part -->

## Debugger

You can also drop a `[%debugger]` expression in a body:

```reason
let f = (x, y) => {
  [%debugger];
  x + y
};
```

Output:

```js
function f (x,y) {
  debugger; // JavaScript developer tools will set an breakpoint and stop here
  x + y;
}
```

## Detect Global Variables

BuckleScript provides a relatively type safe approach for such use case: `external`. `[%external a_single_identifier]` is a value of type `option`. Example:

<!-- TODO: change it to `= None` which is more idiomatic -->

```reason
switch ([%external __DEV__]) {
| Some(_) => Js.log("dev mode")
| None => Js.log("production mode")
};
```

Output:

```js
var match = typeof (__DEV__) === "undefined" ? undefined : (__DEV__);

if (match !== undefined) {
  console.log("dev mode");
} else {
  console.log("production mode");
}
```

Another example:

```reason
switch ([%external __filename]) {
| Some(f) => Js.log(f)
| None => Js.log("non-node environment")
};
```

Output:

```js
var match = typeof (__filename) === "undefined" ? undefined : (__filename);

if (match !== undefined) {
  console.log(match);
} else {
  console.log("non-node environment");
}
```

## Tips & Tricks

Embedding raw JS snippets is **discouraged**, though also highly useful if you're just starting out. As a matter of fact, the first few Reason BuckleScript projects were converted through:

- pasting raw JS snippets inside a file
- examining the JS output (identical)
- gradually extract a few values and functions and making sure the output still looks OK

At the end, we get a fully safe, converted Reason BuckleScript file whose JS output is clean enough that we can confidently assert that no new bug has been introduced during the conversion process.

We have a small guide on this iteration [here](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/interop.html). Feel free to peruse it later.
