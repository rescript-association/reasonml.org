# Conditional Compilation

> This doesn't work with the Reason syntax right now, only the OCaml syntax.

Sometimes you want to write code that works with different versions of compilers and libraries.

People used to use preprocessors like [C preprocessor](http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/cpp.html) for the C family languages. The OCaml community uses several preprocessors: [cppo](https://github.com/mjambon/cppo), [ocp-pp](https://github.com/OCamlPro/typerex-build/tree/master/tools/ocp-pp), camlp4 IFDEF macros, [optcomp](https://github.com/diml/optcomp) and [ppx optcomp](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_optcomp).

Instead of a preprocessor, BuckleScript adds language-level static `if` compilation. It's less powerful than other preprocessors since it only supports static `if` (no `#define`, `#undefine`, `#include`), but there are several advantages.

- It’s tiny (only ~500 lines) and highly efficient. Everything can be done in a **single pass**. It's easy to rebuild the pre-processor into a standalone file, with no dependencies on compiler libs, to back-port it to old OCaml compilers.
- It’s purely functional and type-safe, and cooperates with editor tooling like Merlin.

**Note**: BuckleScript's conditional compilation doesn't work with Reason yet.

## Usage

`lwt_unix.mli`

```ocaml
type open_flag =
    Unix.open_flag =
  | O_RDONLY
  | O_WRONLY
  | O_RDWR
  | O_NONBLOCK
  | O_APPEND
  | O_CREAT
  | O_TRUNC
  | O_EXCL
  | O_NOCTTY
  | O_DSYNC
  | O_SYNC
  | O_RSYNC
#if OCAML_VERSION =~ ">=3.13" then
  | O_SHARE_DELETE
#end
#if OCAML_VERSION =~ ">=4.01" then
  | O_CLOEXEC
#end
```

You don't have to add anything to the build to have these work. The compiler `bsc` understands these already.

## Built-in & Custom Variables

See the output of `bsc.exe -bs-list-conditionals`:

```sh
> bsc.exe -bs-D CUSTOM_A="ghsigh" -bs-list-conditionals
OCAML_PATCH "BS"
BS_VERSION "1.2.1"
OS_TYPE "Unix"
BS true
CUSTOM_A "ghsigh"
WORD_SIZE 64
OCAML_VERSION "4.02.3+BS"
BIG_ENDIAN false
```

Add your custom variable to the mix with `-bs-D MY_VAR="bla"`:

```sh
> bsc.exe -bs-D MY_VAR="bla" -bs-list-conditionals
OCAML_PATCH "BS"
BS_VERSION "1.2.1"
OS_TYPE "Unix"
BS true
MY_VAR="bla"
...
```

## Concrete Syntax

```ocaml
static-if
| HASH-IF-BOL conditional-expression THEN //
   tokens
(HASH-ELIF-BOL conditional-expression THEN) *
(ELSE-BOL tokens)?
HASH-END-BOL

conditional-expression
| conditional-expression && conditional-expression
| conditional-expression || conditional-expression
| atom-predicate

atom-predicate
| atom operator atom
| defined UIDENT
| undefined UIDENT

operator
| (= | < | > | <= | >= | =~ )

atom
| UIDENT | INT | STRING | FLOAT
```

- IF-BOL means `#IF` should be in the beginning of a line.

## Typing Rules

- type of INT is `int`
- type of STRING is `string`
- type of FLOAT is `float`
- value of UIDENT comes from either built-in values (with documented types) or an environment variable, if it is literally `true`, `false` then it is `bool`, else if it is parsable by `int_of_string` then it is of type int, else if it is parsable by `float_of_string` then it is float, otherwise it would be string
- In `lhs operator rhs`, `lhs` and `rhs` are always the same type and return boolean. `=~` is a semantic version operator which requires both sides to be string.

Evaluation rules are obvious. `=~` respect semantic version, for example, the underlying engine

```ocaml
semver Location.none "1.2.3" "~1.3.0" = false;;
semver Location.none "1.2.3" "^1.3.0" = true ;;
semver Location.none "1.2.3" ">1.3.0" = false ;;
semver Location.none "1.2.3" ">=1.3.0" = false ;;
semver Location.none "1.2.3" "<1.3.0" = true ;;
semver Location.none "1.2.3" "<=1.3.0" = true ;;
semver Location.none "1.2.3" "1.2.3" = true;;
```

## Tips & Tricks

This is a very small extension to OCaml. It's backward compatible with OCaml except in the following case:

```ocaml
let f x =
  x
#elif //
```

`#elif` at the beginning of a line is interpreted as static `if`. there is no issue with `#if` or `#end`, since they are already keywords.
