# Event

ReasonReact events map cleanly to ReactJS [synthetic events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html). More info in the [inline docs](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/master/src/ReactEvent.rei#L1).

If you're accessing fields on your event object, like `event.target.value`, you'd use a combination of a `ReactDOMRe` helper and [BuckleScript's `##` object access FFI](/docs/reason-compiler/latest/object#accessors):

```reason
ReactEvent.Form.target(event)##value;
```

Or, equivalently, using the pipe first operator:

```reason
event->ReactEvent.Form.target##value;
```

More info on the `ReactDOMRe` module below in the [Working with DOM](dom.md) section.
