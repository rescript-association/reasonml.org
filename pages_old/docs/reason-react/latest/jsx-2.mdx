# JSX (Old, Version 2)

<Warn>

The Record API is in feature-freeze. For the newest features and better support going forward, please consider migrating to the new <a href="/docs/reason-react/latest/components">function components</a>.

</Warn>

In addition to the [primary JSX transform](jsx.md), you can also use JSX to call older Record components. To do so you can add a `[@bs.config {jsx: 2}];` configuration attribute at the top of a file. Within that file all JSX tags will desugar to the form described here.

## Uncapitalized

```reason
<div foo={bar}> {child1} {child2} </div>
```

transforms into

```reason
ReactDOMRe.createElement("div", ~props=ReactDOMRe.props(~foo=bar, ()), [|child1, child2|]);
```

which compiles to the JS code:

```js
React.createElement('div', {foo: bar}, child1, child2)
```

Prop-less `<div />` transforms into

```reason
ReactDOMRe.createElement("div", [||]);
```

Which compiles to

```js
React.createElement('div', undefined)
```

**Note that `ReactDOMRe.createElement` is intended for internal use by the JSX transform**. For escape-hatch scenarios, use `ReasonReact.createDomElement` instead, as outlined in the [children section](children.md).

## Capitalized

```reason
<MyReasonComponent key={a} ref={b} foo={bar} baz={qux}> {child1} {child2} </MyReasonComponent>
```

transforms into

```reason
ReasonReact.element(
  ~key=a,
  ~ref=b,
  MyReasonComponent.make(~foo=bar, ~baz=qux, [|child1, child2|])
);
```

Prop-less `<MyReasonComponent />` transforms into

```reason
ReasonReact.element(MyReasonComponent.make([||]));
```

The `make` above is exactly the same `make` function you've seen in the previous section.

**Note how `ref` and `key` have been lifted out of the JSX call into the `ReasonReact.element` call**. `ref` and `key` are reserved in ReasonReact, just like in ReactJS. **Don't** use them as props in your component!

## Fragment

```reason
<> child1 child2 </>;
```

transforms into

```reason
ReactDOMRe.createElement(ReasonReact.fragment, [|child1, child2|]);
```

Which compiles to

```js
React.createElement(React.Fragment, undefined, child1, child2);
```

## Children

ReasonReact children are **fully typed**, and you can pass any data structure to it (as long as the receiver component permits it). When you write:

```reason
<MyReasonComponent> <div /> <div /> </MyReasonComponent>
```

You're effectively passing the array `[| <div />, <div /> |]` to `MyReasonComponent`'s children. But this also means that the following wouldn't work:

```reason
let theChildren = [| <div />, <div /> |];
<MyReasonComponent> theChildren </MyReasonComponent>
```

Because this actually translates to:

```reason
let theChildren = [| <div />, <div /> |];
ReasonReact.element(
  MyReasonComponent.make([|theChildren|])
);
```

Which wraps the already wrapped `theChildren` in another layer of array. To solve this issue, Reason has a special [children spread syntax](/docs/manual/latest/jsx#children-spread):

```reason
let theChildren = [| <div />, <div /> |];
<MyReasonComponent> ...theChildren </MyReasonComponent>
```

This simply passes `theChildren` without array wrapping. It becomes:

```reason
let theChildren = [| <div />, <div /> |];
ReasonReact.element(
  MyReasonComponent.make(theChildren)
);
```

For more creative ways of leveraging Reason's type system, data structures and performance to use `children` to its full potential, see the [Children section](children.md)!
