# Blogpost Guide

<Intro>
Here you can find all the information needed to write and publish a new blog post
on reasonml.org.
</Intro>

## Requirements

Clone the [reasonml.org repo](https://github.com/reason-association/reasonml.org) and follow the README instructions to run the local development server.

Open the [localhost:3000/blog](/blog) page to see the blog page.

## Create a new file

Blogposts are located in the `./_blogposts` directory, which consists of
subdirectories for each available blog category:

- community
- compiler
- docs
- ecosystem
- syntax

### Filename Rules

- The file needs to be put into the `_blogposts` directory (or in one of its
  subdirectories)
- The filename must be **unique across the whole `_blogposts` directory and
  its subdirectories** (since filenames are mapped to the url `/blog/[filename]`)
- File extension must be `.mdx`
- Make sure to choose a meaningful filename (it will be used within the url)

**Filename examples:**

- ✅ `bucklescript-release-X-X-X.mdx`: Shows that the release is
  BuckleScript related
- ✅ `cool-thing-to-expect-in-bucklescript-8.mdx`: Here, the filename replicates the
  title, context / version number is well communicated
- ❌ `new-version.mdx`: Bad, since there's no context about the release
  platform. Also `new-version` is very relative; we need more context on the
  version number

**Example for creating a file within the reasonml.org repository:**

```sh
touch _blogposts/compiler/bucklescript-release-1-0-0.mdx
touch _blogposts/some-other-post.mdx
```

After creating the file, refresh your browser on the [/blog](/blog) url.  You
will see a warning because of malformed frontmatter data. Let's fix this!

## Add Frontmatter Data

Each blogpost requires a certain set of meta information (so called
"frontmatter"), otherwise it can't be displayed in the blog.

In
development mode, you will see error messages for invalid frontmatter on the
`localhost:3000/blog` url. Blogposts with invalid frontmatter will not be
rendered and displayed in production, so make sure to fix those errors.

Frontmatter is put **on the top of your file**. Here is a fully working example
of all available attributes:

```
---
author: hongbo
co-authors:
  - chenglou
  - ryyppy
date: "2017-10-01" 
previewImg:
category: compiler
badge: release
title: Bloomberg announces BuckleScript 1.0
description: |
  some multiline
  description
canonical: https://bucklescript.github.io/blog/2017/10/01/announcing-1-0
---
```

- `author`: An author alias as defined in `./index_data/blog_authors.json`
- `co-authors`: A list of co-author aliases (same aliases allowed as in the `author` field)
- `date`: A **string** date (always make sure to use the `"`, otherwise yaml
  will parse it as a `date`). The date format is `"YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm"`. All blog
  posts are ordered ascending by date.
- `previewImg`: The image shown in the blog overview, which will also be used
  as a link preview image
- `category`: Categories as listed in [Creating a new
  File](#creating-a-new-file)
- `badge`: An additional badge on the blog, on top of the preview image.
  Available values are `release`, `testing`, `preview`, `roadmap`
- `title`: The title of the article (h1 headline)
- `description`: A description, which will be shown in the Featured blog post
  in the blog overview, and also as an introductory text in the blog article
- `canonical`: This is used to point to a canonical url (mostly for refering to
  the original source of a post, in case it is duplicated content)

> **For Maintainers:** The implementation for the frontmatter logic can be found in the
`common/BlogFrontmatter.re` module.
