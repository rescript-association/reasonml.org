# A better Documentation Platform for Reason

The website `reasonml.org` is a community project dedicated to a better doc
experience for the Reason & BuckleScript platform and is currently a **Work in
Progress**. Project announcements and current roadmap are documented
[here](https://www.reason-association.org/projects/better-learning-materials-and-tools).

**Current Focus:** [Belt API documentation](/belt_docs) & [Js API documentation](/js_docs)

## Official Resources

In case you are looking for the current official docs, here is a good reference sheet:

- [Reason Language Reference](https://reasonml.github.io/)
- [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/)
- [BuckleScript’s OCaml Stdlib](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js.html)
- [BuckleScript’s Belt Stdlib](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Belt.html)
- [Esy Package Manager](https://esy.sh)
- [GenType](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType)
- [Sketch.sh](https://sketch.sh)
- [Redex Package Index](https://redex.github.io/)

## How to contribute

We are currently in the process of extracting Belt documentation from the
BuckleScript source code. Each module (e.g. `Belt.List`) will have its own
dedicated markdown file.

**Possibilities for contributions:**

- Extract documentation from the original source code w/ conversion to Reason syntax
- Improvement of usage examples
- Working on mechanics to automatically verify & test the examples inside the markdown for CI

The project is still in an early stage, so we don't have any contribution
guidelines yet. As a start, refer to existing modules and ask questions on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) or ping [@ryyppy](https://twitter.com/ryyppy).
