# reasonml.org is deprecated.

> **Please visit [reasonml.github.io](https://reasonml.github.io/) for the latest ReasonML content.**

> **For BuckleScript / JS related docs, please refer to [rescript-lang.org](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/v8.0.0)**

We started the `reasonml.org` project to unify the BuckleScript, ReasonReact and Reason language documentation in one coherent documentation platform. On July 1st 2020, [BuckleScript officially rebranded to ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/blog/bucklescript-is-rebranding) to create a more lightweight and JS focused derivate of the ReasonML language.

This doesn't mean this project is over. We are dedicated to cater to our BuckleScript / Reason JS users, so our work will continue on [rescript-lang.org](https://rescript-lang.org).


## Where did the original docs go?

All of reasonml.org's BuckleScript / Reason webdev related resources have been moved to [ReScript's v8.0.0 documentation](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/v8.0.0), which is still documented in Reason syntax.

<Warn>

We will automatically redirect reasonml.org based urls to the correct canonical resource, so your shared links will continue to work until we handed over the domain to the Reason team.

</Warn>

## How to migrate from BuckleScript to ReScript?

The ReScript team has a strong commitment for supporting our existing Reason / BuckleScript users. Please refer to the [ReScript Q&A](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/rescript-frequently-asked-questions/59) to learn more about our compatibility with Reason and on how to upgrade your projects to ReScript in the future.

## What about ReasonML?

Reason will continue to be an alternative syntax for OCaml and focus on native / cross compilation for all platforms.
You can find all Reason related content on following resources:

- [reasonml.github.io](https://reasonml.github.io/) for the core language reference
- [reason-native.com](https://reason-native.com/) for Reason Native related tools
- [esy.sh](https://esy.sh) for the Reason / OCaml package manager
