## Current Focus / Open Tasks

Following sections are just a rough outline on what needs to be done in the
next steps:

### Docs:

- ~~Upstream the Reason language docs from reasonml.github.io~~
- ~~Upstream the BuckleScript docs from bucklescript.github.io~~
- ~~Upstream GenType docs~~
- Merge Reason's & BuckleScript's docs into one cohesive document

### API documentation:

- Refining the [Belt API](/apis/javascript/latest/belt) & [Js API](/apis/javascript/latest/js) documentation by hand via markdown
- Deep dive into `odoc` to extract API documentation from the BuckleScript modules' source code
- Upstream our markdown curated changes of the Belt / Js modules into the BuckleScript source code

### Playground:

- Implement the design for
[mobile](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/1cd19c3a-a0bb-4f93-4e11-725589888696-6ae0/screen/adfe80dc-6bc1-40a5-9975-aa062e63cdc5/Reason-Playground)
and
[desktop](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/1cd19c3a-a0bb-4f93-4e11-725589888696-6ae0/screen/e8559ac4-5e35-430b-83f3-e4ad8c1e274c/Reason-1400-Playground)
- Improve the BuckleScript generated playground bundle for our use-cases (see
[issue](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/3857#issuecomment-558540278))
- Improve the workflow for generating third-party package bundles (define a protocol on how to hook those into the playground engine)
- Integrate the Playground Engine + ReasonReact 3rd Party dep into the UI (see
the [NIT](https://github.com/Sketch-sh/nit/tree/406) playground for
inspiration)

### Search Functionality:

- Build the custom Search overlay (see the
[design](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/1cd19c3a-a0bb-4f93-4e11-725589888696-6ae0/screen/5ef4d42c-05eb-4117-82b6-a2906e652ff1/Reason-1400-Nav-Search))
- Add Algolia's OSS webscraper engine and wire it up with our UI
- Generate indexing data via `odoc` and use a paid plan for Algolia's indexing service
- Tweak UI for API vs. whole page searches
