# Belt

A stdlib shipped with BuckleScript This stdlib is still in beta but we
encourage you to try it out and give us feedback.

## Motivation

The motivation for creating such library is to provide BuckleScript users a
better end-to-end user experience, since the original OCaml stdlib was not
written with JS in mind. Below is a list of areas this lib aims to improve:

Consistency in name convention: camlCase, and arguments order Exception thrown
functions are all suffixed with Exn, e.g, getExn Better performance and smaller
code size running on JS platform

## Name Convention

For higher order functions, it will be suffixed U if it takes uncurried callback.

```
let forEach: (t('a), 'a => unit) => unit;
let forEachU: (t('a), [@bs] ('a => unit)) => unit;
```

In general, uncurried version will be faster, but it may be less familiar to
people who have a background in functional programming.


## A special encoding for collection safety

When we create a collection library for a custom data type we need a way to
provide a comparator function. Take Set for example, suppose its element type
is a pair of ints, it needs a custom compare function that takes two tuples and
returns their order. The Set could not just be typed as Set.t (int * int) , its
customized compare function needs to manifest itself in the signature,
otherwise, if the user creates another customized compare function, the two
collection could mix which would result in runtime error.

The original OCaml stdlib solved the problem using functor which creates a big
closure at runtime and makes dead code elimination much harder. We use a
phantom type to solve the problem:

```
module Comparable1 =
  Belt.Id.MakeComparable(
    {
      type t = (int, int);
      let cmp = ((a0, a1), (b0, b1)) =>
        switch (Pervasives.compare(a0, b0)) {
        | 0 => Pervasives.compare(a1, b1)
        | c => c
        };
    }
  );

let mySet1 = Belt.Set.make(~id=(module Comparable1));

module Comparable2 =
  Belt.Id.MakeComparable(
    {
      type t = (int, int);
      let cmp = ((a0, a1), (b0, b1)) =>
        switch (Pervasives.compare(a0, b0)) {
        | 0 => Pervasives.compare(a1, b1)
        | c => c
        };
    }
  );

let mySet2 = Belt.Set.make(~id=(module Comparable2));
```

Here, the compiler would infer mySet1 and mySet2 having different type, so e.g.
a `merge` operation that tries to merge these two sets will correctly fail.

```
let mySet1: t((int, int), Comparable1.identity);
let mySet2: t((int, int), Comparable2.identity);
```

`Comparable1.identity` and `Comparable2.identity` are not the same using our
encoding scheme.

## Collection Hierarchy

In general, we provide a generic collection module, but also create specialized
modules for commonly used data type. Take `Belt.Set` for example, we provide:

```
Belt.Set
Belt.Set.Int
Belt.Set.String
```

The specialized modules `Belt.Set.Int`, `Belt.Set.String` are in general more
efficient.

Currently, both `Belt_Set` and `Belt.Set` are accessible to users for some
technical reasons, we strongly recommend users stick to qualified import,
`Belt.Set`, we may hide the internal, i.e, `Belt_Set` in the future
