# Extended Compiler Options

**Note**: this section is only for people who want roll their own build system instead of using the recommended build system, `bsb`. This also provides some tips for contributors who debug the compiler.

BuckleScript inherits the command line arguments of the [OCaml compiler](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/comp.html). It also adds several BS-specific flags. Run `bsc -help` to see the list.

All these flags can be passed into the `bsc-flags` section of `bsb` (though some of them don't make sense to be passed).

**Note** also that this section isn't kept very up-to-date. Contributions welcome!

## -bs-main (single directory build)

```sh
bsc -bs-main Main
```

`bsc` will build module `Main` and all its dependencies. When it finishes, it'll run `node main.js`.

```sh
bsc -c -bs-main Main
```

Same as above, but will not run `node`.

## -bs-files

So that you can do

```sh
bsc -c -bs-files *.ml *.mli
```

the compiler will sort the order of input files before starting compilation.

BuckleScript supports two compilation modes: script mode and package mode. In package mode, you have to provide `package.json` on top and set the options `-bs-package-name`, `-bs-package-output`. In script mode, such flags are not needed.

## -bs-package-name

The name of your project. It's recommended to use the same `name` than the one in `package.json`.

## -bs-package-output

Configure the output module system. The format is `module_system:output/path/relative/to/package.json`.

Currently supported systesms are: `commonjs`, `amdjs` and `es6`.

For example, when you want to use the `es6` module system:

```sh
bsc -bs-package-name your_package -bs-package-output es6:lib/es6 -c xx.ml
```

**Note**: you can supply multiple `-bs-package-output` at once. For example:

```sh
bsc -bs-package-name name -bs-package-output commonjs:lib/js  -bs-package-output amdjs:lib/amdjs -c x.ml
```

It'll generate `x.js` in `lib/js` as a commonjs module, `lib/amdjs` as an amdjs module at the same time.

You would then need a bundler for the different module systems: webpack supports `commonjs` and `amdjs`, rollup supports es6, while google closure compiler supports all.

## -bs-no-warn-ffi-type

Turn off warnings on FFI type declarations.

## -bs-eval

Example:

```sh
> bsc -dparsetree -drawlambda -bs-eval 'Js.log "hello"'

[
  structure_item (//toplevel//[1,0+0]..[1,0+14])
    Pstr_eval
    expression (//toplevel//[1,0+0]..[1,0+14])
      Pexp_apply
      expression (//toplevel//[1,0+0]..[1,0+6])
        Pexp_ident "Js.log" (//toplevel//[1,0+0]..[1,0+6])
      [
        <label> ""
          expression (//toplevel//[1,0+7]..[1,0+14])
            Pexp_constant Const_string("hello",None)
      ]
]

(setglobal Bs_internal_eval! (seq (log "hello") (makeblock 0)))
// Generated by BUCKLESCRIPT VERSION 2.1.0, PLEASE EDIT WITH CARE
'use strict';


console.log("hello");

/*  Not a pure module */
```

In conjunction with `-bs-eval`: the first block is the output of `-dparsetree`, the second is from `-drawlambda`.

`-bs-eval` doesn't create intermediate file. Useful for learning or troubleshooting.

## -bs-no-builtin-ppx-ml, -bs-no-builtin-ppx-mli

If you don't use any BS-specific annotations, you can explicitly turn it off. Another use-case is to use `-ppx` explicitly as below:

```sh
bsc -c -ppx bsppx.exe -bs-no-builtin-ppx-ml c.ml
```

## -bs-no-version-header

Donâ€™t print BS version at the beginning of each JS file.

## -bs-g (Experimental, since @3.1.0)
