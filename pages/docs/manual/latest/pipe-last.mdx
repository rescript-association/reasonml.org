# Pipe Last

<Warn>

We discourage the usage of the `|>` / pipe-last operator in BuckleScript codebases. Using it may sometimes have a runtime cost due to currying.
Please use the [pipe-first](./pipe-first) operator instead.

Pipe-last is mainly used in native / OCaml codebases or in functional programming libraries
aiming for a `data last` approach. You'll also find it in older Reason codebases and libraries.

</Warn>

[`|>`](https://reasonml.github.io/api/Pervasives.html#VAL(|%3E)) is an infix operator for piping a value to the last argument position of a function.

**Example:**

```reason
let personSays = (person, msg) => person ++ " says: " ++ msg;

"This will be put in the msg arg"
  |> personSays("Alpaca");

/* Returns: "Alpaca says: This will be put in the msg arg */
```

### Differences between pipe-last and pipe-first

- Pipe-last is a **binding to a compiler intrinsic,** it will optimize some currying, but not all. Pipe-first (`->`) is implemented as syntactic sugar within BuckleScript and guarantees zero extra currying overhead.
- Pipe-last can't pipe into a variant constructor (see `1->Some`)

For a more thorough discussion on the rationale and differences between the two operators,
please refer to the [Data-first and Data-last comparison by Javier ChÃ¡varri](https://www.javierchavarri.com/data-first-and-data-last-a-comparison/)

### Note on Precedence

Mixing both pipe operators might lead to confusion, since the pipe-first operator has a higher precedence. For example:

```reason
let maybeGreeting = Some("hello");

maybeGreeting |> Belt.Option.isSome -> Js.log;
```

will not compile, since the compiler will process the `->` first (`Belt.Option.isSome -> Js.log`)
before applying `maybeGreeting` to `Belt.Option.isSome`. A fix for the example above would involve
using parenthesis, like this:

```reason
let maybeGreeting = Some("hello");

(maybeGreeting |> Belt.Option.isSome) -> Js.log;
```
