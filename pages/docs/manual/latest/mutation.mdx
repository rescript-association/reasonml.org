# Mutation

Reason has great traditional imperative & mutative programming capabilities. You should use these features sparingly, but sometimes they allow your code to be more performant and written in a more familiar pattern.

## Mutate Let-binding

Let-bindings are immutable, but you can wrap it with a `ref`, which is like a box whose content can change:

```reason
let foo = ref(5);
```

## Usage

You can get the actual value of a `ref` through the postfix `^` operator:

```reason
let five = foo^; /* 5 */
```

Assign a new value to `foo` like so:

```reason
foo := 6;
```

Note that the previous binding `five` stays `5`, since it got the underlying item on the `ref` box, not the `ref` itself.

## Tip & Tricks

**Just kidding**! `ref` isn't actually a special feature! It's just an ordinary syntax sugar for a [predefined mutable record type called `ref`](//reasonml.github.io/api/Pervasives.html#TYPEref) in the standard library (search "References" in that page). Here's the desugared version:

```reason
let foo = {contents: 5};
let five = foo.contents;
foo.contents = 6;
```

Before reaching for `ref`, know that you can achieve lightweight, local "mutations" through overriding let bindings:

```reason
let foo = 10;
let foo = someCondition ? foo + 5 : foo;
print_int(foo); /* either 15 or 10 */
```
