# GenType

`genType` lets you export [Reason](/docs/manual/latest/introduction) values and
types to use in JavaScript, and import JavaScript values and types into Reason,
idiomatically. Converter functions between the two representations are
generated based on the type of the value. The converters can be generated in
vanilla JavaScript, or in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) /
[Flow](https://flow.org/en/) for a type-safe idiomatic interface. In
particular, conversion of [ReasonReact](/docs/reason-react/latest/introduction)
components both ways is supported, with automatic generation of the wrappers.

Here's an article describing how to use `genType` as part of a migration
strategy where a tree of components is gradually converted to Reason bottom-up:
[Adopting Reason: strategies, dual sources of truth, and why genType is a big
deal](https://www.javierchavarri.com/adopting-reason-strategies-dual-sources-of-truth-and-why-gentype-is-a-big-deal/).

The implementation of [@genType] performs a type-directed transformation of
Reason programs after
[bucklescript](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript) compilation. The
transformed programs operate on data types idiomatic to JS. For example, a
Reason function operating on a Reason variant `type t  = | A(int) | B(string)`
(which is represented as custom blocks at runtime) is exported to a JS function
operating on the corresponding JS object of type `{ tag: "A"; value: number }
  | { tag: "B"; value: string }`.

The output of `genType` can be configured by using one of 3 back-ends:
`untyped` to generate wrappers in vanilla JS, `typescript` to generate
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and `flow` to generate JS with
[Flow](https://flow.org/en/) type annotations.

## A More Concrete Example

Let's assume we are working on a TypeScript (TS) codebase and we want to
integrate a single ReasonReact component.

Firstly we want to be able to import the ReasonReact component like any other
React component, secondly we also want to preserve all the Reason types in the
TS type system (and convert incompatible values if necessary). **That's what's
`genType` was made for!**


First we'll set up a ReasonReact component just like this (we will assume that
`genType` and `bs-platform` is already configured correctly):

```re
/* src/MyComp.re */

[@genType]
type color =
  | Red
  | Blue;

[@genType]
[@react.component]
let make = (~name: string, ~color: color) => {
  let colorStr =
    switch (color) {
    | Red => "red"
    | Blue => "blue"
    };

  <div className={"color-" ++ colorStr}> name->React.string </div>;
};
```

> **Note:** We need to add a `[@genType]` annotation for `type color` as well,
otherwise `genType` cannot create any type conversions for us.

On a successful compile, `genType` will convert `MyComp.re` to a TS file called
`src/MyComp.gen.ts` which will look something like this:

```ts
// src/MyComp.gen.tsx

/* TypeScript file generated from MyComp.re by genType. */
/* eslint-disable import/first */


import * as React from 'react';

const $$toRE818596289: { [key: string]: any } = {"Red": 0, "Blue": 1};

// tslint:disable-next-line:no-var-requires
const MyCompBS = require('./MyComp.bs');

// tslint:disable-next-line:interface-over-type-literal
export type color = "Red" | "Blue";

// tslint:disable-next-line:interface-over-type-literal
export type Props = { readonly color: color; readonly name: string };

export const make: React.ComponentType<{ readonly color: color; readonly name: string }> = function MyComp(Arg1: any) {
  const $props = {color:$$toRE818596289[Arg1.color], name:Arg1.name};
  const result = React.createElement(MyCompBS.make, $props);
  return result
};
```


Note how `genType` automatically maps the `color` variant to TS via a string
union type `color = "Red" | "Blue"`.  We can seamlessly use Reason specific
data structures within TS without doing any manual transformations!

Now, within our TypeScript application, we can now import and use the React
component in following manner:

```ts
// src/App.ts
import { make as MyComp } from "./MyComp.gen.tsx";

const App = () => {
  <div>
    <h1> My Component </h1>
    <MyComp color="Blue" name="Reason & TypeScript" />
  </div>
};
```

We are only scratching the surface on what `genType` can actually do. For more
