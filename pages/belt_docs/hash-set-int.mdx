# HashSetInt

This module is `Belt.HashSet` specialized with key type to be a primitive type.

It is more efficient in general, the API is the same with `Belt.HashSet` except its key type is fixed, and identity is not needed(using the built-in one).

## key

```
type key = int;
```

## t

```
type t;
```

## make

```
let make: (~hintSize: int) => t;
```

## clear

```
let clear: t => unit;
```

## isEmpty

```
let isEmpty: t => bool;
```

## add

```
let add: (t, key) => unit;
```

## copy

```
let copy: t => t;
```

## has

```
let has: (t, key) => bool;
```

## remove

```
let remove: (t, key) => unit;
```

## forEachU

```
let forEachU: (t, [@bs] (key => unit)) => unit;
```

## forEach

```
let forEach: (t, key => unit) => unit;
```

## reduceU

```
let reduceU: (t, 'c, [@bs] (('c, key) => 'c)) => 'c;
```

## reduce

```
let reduce: (t, 'c, ('c, key) => 'c) => 'c;
```

## size

```
let size: t => int;
```

## logStats

```
let logStats: t => unit;
```

## toArray

```
let toArray: t => array(key);
```

## fromArray

```
let fromArray: array(key) => t;
```

## mergeMany

```
let mergeMany: (t, array(key)) => unit;
```

## getBucketHistogram

```
let getBucketHistogram: t => array(int);
```
